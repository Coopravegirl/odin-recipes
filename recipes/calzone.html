    <h1>Calzone</h1>

    <img src="../recipes/calzone.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Calzone I consider something to get based on a craving, from some restauraunt, it is like a "shadow food" associated with teen boys, 
    grease, gaming on shooters in a dark room super blasted and drinking some energy drink</p>

    <p>I've been obsessed with that idea, the junk food concepts. He's sinking into a level of cyber trance that makes him see the lines, he's wearing all leather and spikes, 
        an esports gaming T-Shirt, and listening to like Sepultura, some nu metal stuff. Glowing TV screen in a dark room.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Restauraunt order</li>
            <li>Large fountain soda or an energy drink</li>
            <li>Robocough gels</li>
            <li>Halo 2 or 3, and some more obscure RPG that's kinda heavy</li>
            <li>Thrash records</li>
            <li>Sci fi novels</li>
            <li>Terminator 2: Judgement day</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Exit gaming stupor momentarily, stare into the meal</li>
            <li>After devouring the greasy thing, progress to next stage, enter back into room</li>
            <li>With the lights the right color, consume the robo gels and your soda</li>
            <li>As things become, set down the gaming controller and put in terminator on mute, the sepultura record playing softly in the background</li>
            <li>See the cover of the RPG, notice a girl on the front of your sci fi novel who you never knew you thought of so much</li>
            <li>Highlight everything relating to that alien princess, you're in the game world, you're that alien princess, you're fueled</li>
            <li>The lines between your princess-ness and your liquid-metalness melt and coalesce</li>
        </ol>
